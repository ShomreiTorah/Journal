# Journal
Manages a synagogue journal, integrating with the Shomrei Torah billing system.

# Installation

The journal codebase is a completely standalone installation, but requires that the ShomreiTorahConfig.xml registry key be set (eg, by clicking `Set ShomreiTorahConfig Path` in the Billing, from a complete distribution with organization-specific config).

 1. Add https://tiferesboruch.org/Updates/ to Trusted Sites in Internet Options (to enable unsigned VSTO addins).
 2. Install from https://tiferesboruch.org/Updates/ShomreiTorah.Journal/ShomreiTorah.Journal.vsto in IE or Edge (so that it preserves the origin).
